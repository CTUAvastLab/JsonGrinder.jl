Data on hospital-acquired respiratory virus infections are still very scarce, mostly confined to influenza virus infections. A Canadian group reported that among hospitalized patients in 51 Canadian hospitals, 23.2%-23.6% of influenza virus infections were health careassociated infections. 8 A German group recently reported the proportion of hospital-acquired influenza virus infection as 20.5%-24.6%. 9 Our rate of such infections (28.1%) was somewhat higher than prior reports. Our inclusion of pediatric patients may have been responsible for this. Of note, the influenza virus was responsible for only 13.9% of all hospital-acquired respiratory viral infections.

The use of more sensitive PCR kits in recent years may also have affected the incidence of respiratory viral infection. However, because the reported sensitivities of the 2 assays (93.3% and 95.2%, respectively) are similar, 5 the impact of changes in the PCR kits is not likely to have been substantial. Surprisingly, the incidence of respiratory virus infections was highest in ICUs. Considering the brevity of ICU stays (median, 4 days) before the detection of viruses, it is probable that most of the cases were hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections that occurred in wards, not in the ICUs. These findings are consistent with those of a Spanish group, which showed that during the influenza season, 29.5% of critical patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infections had influenza, 42% of which were hospital acquired. 10 It has also been reported that respiratory viruses were responsible for 22.5% of cases of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission in adults. 11 These results strongly suggest that hospital-acquired infections caused by respiratory viruses could lead to serious consequences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1239, "end": 1241, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1404, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This study had several limitations.
