However, few studies have focused on children and their parents' psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A preliminary study conducted in China during the pandemic showed that children between the ages of 3 and 6 years were more likely to manifest symptoms such as clinginess and fears about the pandemic, while children aged 6-18 years were more likely to show inattention and persistent inquiry (Jiao et al., 2020) .",

The current stressful circumstances of home confinement and major changes to daily routines, higher levels of anxiety, decrease in daylight exposure, increased blue light exposure due to massive reliance on digital media, changes in diet, and reduced physical activity may all have negative implications for sleep quality (Altena et al., 2020; Becker & Gregory, 2020) . A recent study exploring sleep health among an adult Greek population during the COVID-19 crisis (Voitsidis et al., 2020) showed that 37.6% of the participants scored above the cut-off score for insomnia, which is significantly greater than the 10% worldwide insomnia prevalence estimated before the pandemic (Riemann et al., 2017) . These results emphasise the possible effects of the changes imposed by the COVID-19 crisis on insomnia, a disorder associated with increased risk of chronic illnesses, poor mental health, functional limitations, and cognitive decline (Riemann et al., 2015) . Another study conducted recently among an Italian population found that, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, spending more time in bed, and reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was more pronounced in people with a higher level of depression and anxiety (Cellini et al., 2020) .",

Notwithstanding these significant findings, it is important to note that the majority of mothers reported no change in their child's sleep quality, duration, arrangement, and their perception of child's sleep as problematic. Moreover, 12% of mothers even reported a positive change in their child's sleep quality, and 25% reported an increase in sleep duration. These findings emphasise the importance of further exploring familial resiliency factors that may explain the different patterns of responses in children's and mothers' sleep during times of crises. This is particularly important given the role of sleep in child development and parental functioning.",

The majority of mothers reported no change in their child's sleep quality, duration, arrangement, and their perception of child's sleep as problematic, while the rates of reported change ranged between 19.3% to 35% for the different variables. Also, 12% of mothers reported a positive change in child sleep quality, and 25% reported an increase in sleep duration. These findings suggest that the changes in sleep patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are varied and that no unified change for the worse should be expected(Altena et al., 2020;Becker & Gregory, 2020). Furthermore, while a somewhat higher level of trait anxiety was found among the mothers of children with reported negative change in their sleep quality, no differences were found in regard to the level of maternal acute anxiety, compared to children with no such change. These findings could indicate that, in times of crises, factors related to maternal personality tendencies may be more strongly associated with maternal perceptions of their children's sleep, compared to acute maternal anxiety.",
