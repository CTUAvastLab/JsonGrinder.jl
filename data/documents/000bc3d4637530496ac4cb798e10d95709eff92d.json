Recent FDA clearance of molecular-based multiplex panels represents the beginning of a new era for the diagnosis of respiratory infections. The ability to test for multiple pathogens simultaneously, accompanied by the increasing availability of molecular-based assays for newly recognized respiratory pathogens will likely have a major impact on patient care, drug development, and public health epidemiology.

FDA recognizes two major situations for assessing the diagnostic performance of new qualitative diagnostic tests: when a clinical reference method is available or when a comparator other than a reference method is used. In the former circumstance, a clinical reference method is considered to be the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target organism [1] but the reference method cannot incorporate results reported by the new device; for example, a new enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) could not be used as one of the diagnostic criteria for the reference method in a study used to evaluate the performance of the assay. Confusion may sometimes arise when distinguishing between analytical and clinical reference method since these may be identical or separate in different contexts; for example, the performance characteristics for a new assay for group A streptococcus against an analytical reference method such as culture on appropriate media may only be valid in the clinical setting of pharyngitis, since group A streptococcus may be a normal colonizer and performance may be different in the setting of colonization versus infection. In contrast, the analytical and clinical reference methods for influenza A are identical since the presence of influenza A is always considered abnormal. Determining the appropriate clinical reference methods may be particularly complex in the setting of multiplex assays for diseases with multiple etiologies such as community-acquired pneumonia, and where two or more possible pathogens may be isolated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 504, "end": 507, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Reference Methods and Clinical Studies"}, {"text": "Newly identified organisms introduce different challenges in selecting the appropriate reference method; for example, more recently identified pathogens such as metapneumovirus may be difficult to isolate or confirm by traditional methods such as culture.

Similar concerns exist for assays that differentiate subtypes of novel influenza, a disease where diagnostics are essential but where relatively few clinical specimens are available for confirming performance. There are recent FDA guidances that are useful in aiding companies in developing valid comparators.

Assay Performance Characteristics: Statistics 101 for Diagnostic Devices Sensitivity/specificity. The simplest approach to describing diagnostic performance characteristics is when every test result can be described qualitatively (eg, analyte detected or not detected), and where a reference method exists. For a prospectively enrolled study where patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the IU of the device, agreement of the test results with the reference method establishes sensitivity and specificity of the test device.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assay Interpretation"}, {"text": "Sensitivity is the probability that the new device will have a positive test result given that the clinical reference method is positive; it is estimated in a clinical study as the fraction of patients that are positive by the new test among those that are positive by the clinical reference method. For example, in a study of novel H1N1 influenza, it is the percent of patients that both test positive by the new device and are positive via the reference assay divided by the number of patients positive by the reference assay. Low test sensitivity reflects less security with the results of a negative test; that is, patients with the disease may be falsely labeled as negative by the new assay. (This fundamental consideration, i.e., -equating ''analyte not detected'' with the absence of disease [or the analyte]-is a common misinterpretation that bedevils the clinical use of devices with imperfect sensitivity.). Specificity is the converse; that is, the probability that the new device will have a negative test result given that the clinical reference method is negative. Specificity is estimated in the pivotal study by the fraction of subjects that are negative by the new test among those that are negative by the clinical reference method. Higher specificity yields greater confidence in a positive result. It is important to recognize that although patients included in specificity calculations do not have the disease of interest, in most cases they are still symptomatic (depending on the specific IU for the test); asymptomatic subjects would not be considered part of the IU population for such a device and therefore would not be appropriate for use in a specificity calculation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assay Interpretation"}, {"text": "There are examples where a new device is not compared with a reference but to a previously cleared/approved device. In this setting, sensitivity and specificity cannot be estimated due to the lack of known infected status. (For example, a benchmark reference standard for aspergillosis infection may include galactomannan as part of the definition of aspergillosis infection in certain populations, even in the absence of invasive procedures to document infection.). Identical statistical calculations can be used in this setting but are interpreted as being positive and negative percent agreement rather than sensitivity and specificity; these considerations are also described in FDA guidance [1] .

In a clinical study with only 5 specimens positive for a specific pathogen (via the reference method) and an observed sensitivity of 5/5 (100%) results in a lower confidence bound of only 55.6%, meaning diagnostic performance is very uncertain. Even for a test with perfect sensitivity, at least 35 patients with the condition of interest would be needed to yield a 95% lower bound greater than 90%. In a pivotal study for devices to detect more common conditions, it is not uncommon to see a sample size of 50 or more patients that are positive via the reference method.
