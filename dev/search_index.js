The drawback is that if one is processing a JSONs with sufficiently big schema, each BagNode can potentially create two types –- one with missing and the other with x <: AbstractNode. This will trigger a lot of compilation, which at the moment can take quite some time especially when calculating gradients with Zygote.\nx <: AbstractNode with nobs(x) = 0. In other words, x would be the same type as it is if it contains instances, but it does not any observations. This has the advantage that all extracted samples will be of the same type and therefore there will be only single compilation for inference (and gradients). This is nice, but at the expense of less elegant code and probably small overhead caused by descending into children. This approach also needs a support from extractors, as creating an empty sample might be a bit tricky. As mentioned in preceding section, if an extractor wants its children to extract this special sample with zero observations, it asks them to extract a special singleton JsonGrider.extractempty.
