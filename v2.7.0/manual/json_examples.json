It is remarkable that the expression of var family members is mutually exclusive. For each parasite at a time, only one or a few var genes are expressed, while the remaining members are silenced [6, 7] . In each generation, P. falciparum is able to express different var genes, and the switches in var gene expression lead to antigenic variation of PfEMP1, which results in immune evasion and chronic infection [8] [9] [10] [11] .

In this process, histone modifying enzymes such as PfMYST, PfGCN5, PfSIR2 and PfSET, have been considered important for epigenetic control of reversible histone modifications, according to previous studies [12, 13] . PfMYST, a putative histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in P. falciparum, is capable of acetylating multiple lysines on H4 [18, 19] , while an orthologue of the yeast HAT PfGCN5 influences acetylation of H3K9 and K14, both are essential marks of gene activation [18, 20] . Two paralogues of the class III HDAC (histone deacetylases) Sir2, play key roles in maintaining heterochromatin and mutually exclusive var gene expression [15, 21, 22] .

PfAlbas contribute to heterochromatin structure and regulation of var gene expression [30] . PfSIP2, another ApiAP2 member, is involved in the recruitment and organization of subtelomeric heterochromatin through binding to SPE2 [31] , and induces a comprehensive silencing of a var promoter. Particularly, four major classes of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers had been found in P. falciparum, facilitating the spatial and temporal remodeling of chromatin [13] . All these remodeler families consist of a SWI2/SNF2family ATPase subunit featuring an ATPase domain [32, 33] , which includes an HSA (helicase-SANT), a post-HSA, and a C-terminal bromodomain. Some other conserved subunits carry extra conserved domains, such as hBAF155/170 (SANT, SWIRM), hBAF60 (SWIB) and human polybromo (multiple bromodomains). BAF60b is generally known as SWI-B or SWIB, an alternative form of the SWI/SNF complex (Complex B) [34] , while human BAF60a protein of SWI/SNF complex is responsible for facilitating cell cycle halting and has the ability to tune the balance between repair and apoptosis induction [35] [36] [37] . Recently, a SWI/ SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, PfSWIB (GenBank: PF3D7_0611400), which is characterized by its SWIB/MDM2 domain (SWI complex, BAF60b domain), has been identified in P. falciparum. PfSWIB might trigger stage-specific PCD by which transient nuclear localization causes removal of these parasites [38] . Further studies revealed that PfSWIB was not only crucial for the survival and growth of the parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins [38] [39] [40] . However, it remains unclear whether PfSWIB is involved in transcriptional regulation of virulence gene, especially vars, and its functional properties."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Background","text":"To address the molecular mechanism of PfSWIB, we propose a new conditional knockdown system to study the function and mechanism of chromatin remodeler PfSWIB in regulating var gene expression.

In addition, PfSWIB knockdown could affect the growth and development of parasite. This study provides a better understanding of the regulatory function of chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) in regulating the clonal variation of var genes, and an essential insight into the regulation of the major virulence gene family contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF42","start":155,"text":"[41]","end":159},{"ref_id":"BIBREF43","start":851,"text":"[42,","end":855},{"ref_id":"BIBREF44","start":856,"text":"43]","end":859}],"section":"Parasite culture","text":"Plasmodium falciparum lines 3D7, PfSWIB and PfSWIB∆ were first thawed and established for continuous cultivation in vitro according to standard procedures [41] .

It has also been demonstrated previously that mammalian SWI/SNF homologs complexes, also known as BRG1-associated factors (BAFs), can be found in multiple forms which consist of 9-12 proteins. Among these BAFs, BAF60b exists in an alternative form of the SWI/ SNF complex (Complex B), which is generally known as SWI-B or SWIB [34] . In humans, the BAF60a protein of the SWI/SNF complex is responsible for p53 binding and regulates its activities via an N-terminal region of the SWIB/MDM2 domain [35] , as well as facilitating cell cycle halting and tune the balance between repair and apoptosis induction [35] [36] [37] . SWIB/MDM2 domains have in fact been shown to participate in protein-protein [60] and chromatin-related interactions [61] , but their functional roles in other species are poorly understood. Similarly, the SWI/SNF complex is composed of constant units and includes the Swp73p/SNF12 protein comprising a SWIB/MDM2 domain, proposed to facilitate specificity and/or functionality to some extent [38, 62] . According to recent studies, the P. falciparum genome encodes two putative SWIB/MDM2 domain-containing proteins: PfMDM2 (PF3D70518200, SWIB/MDM2 domaincontaining protein) and PfSWIB (PF3D70611400, SWI/ SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin) [38] , and PfSWIB was not only crucial for the survival and growth of the parasite, but additionally had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins [38] [39] [40] . Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that PfSWIB is characterized by its SWIB domain (BAF60b domain, PlasmoDB, http://plasm odb. org/). Bonger et al. [45] have recently developed a new technique by which the degradation of a specific protein is definitely induced by way of a small molecule, shield1. Hence, an in-depth functional analysis of PfSWIB based on the conditional knock-down assay was implemented in the present study. By using a transgenic assay, drug screening and subsequent screening of the clones, we obtained two integrated parasite clones PfSWIB-C2 and B10, with a stable transfection of the modified locus PfSWIB-FKBP-LID into the Plasmodium parasites (Fig. 1 , Additional file 3: Figure S1 ). Western blot analysis confirmed that the fusion expression protein was successfully expressed in the transfected parasite lines, and there was a significant decrease of PfSWIB fusion protein expression in the PfSWIB∆ line (t (2) = 4.890, P = 0.0394), at its trophozoite stage within third life-cycle of P. falciparum. However, it should be noted that no significant change was detected in the protein expression level of PfSWIB fusion system during the ring stage, either in the presence or absence of drug pressure (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). This could be due to at least two reasons. First, it takes time for shield1 to work at full capacity through binding to LID, therefore, a portion or slight loss of fused PfSWIB protein could not be identified. Secondly, this protein might be expressed predominantly at the mature stage of P. falciparum."},{"ref_spans":[{"ref_id":"FIGREF2","start":1260,"text":"(Fig. 2a)","end":1269}],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF34","start":257,"text":"[35]","end":261},{"ref_id":"BIBREF37","start":278,"text":"[38]","end":282},{"ref_id":"BIBREF37","start":572,"text":"[38]","end":576},{"ref_id":"BIBREF40","start":716,"text":"[39,","end":720},{"ref_id":"BIBREF41","start":721,"text":"40]","end":724},{"ref_id":"BIBREF40","start":877,"text":"[39,","end":881},{"ref_id":"BIBREF41","start":882,"text":"40]","end":885}],"section":"Discussion","text":"It is worth noting that PfSWIB may lead to stage-specific PCD, in the same way as BAF60a of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex induces p53-directed apoptosis, by which transient nuclear localization results in removal of these parasites, as previously described [35] . Vieira et al. [38] further demonstrated that PfSWIB could have a stage-specific, pro-survival function and takes part in the heat stress response of the Plasmodium parasite. They discovered that PfSWIB and PfARK3 participate in preventing p53-mediated apoptosis within the nucleus in reaction to heat stress [38] . Alternatively, human Aurora kinase B and its yeast homologue play key roles during gene transcription through histone H3 phosphorylation [39, 40] . Likewise, PfSWIB could also have an effect on parasite survival through transcriptional regulation by guiding the PfARK3's phosphorylation activities [39, 40] . In our study, growth curve analysis of P. falciparum revealed that a relatively low parasitemia was observed in the PfSWIB knockdown line (PfSWIB∆) when compared to other parasite lines during their second life-cycle. Significant change was observed after 96 hours, when the parasites developed into the third life-cycle.

[27] proved that knocking out the P. falciparum variant-silencing SET gene, which encodes an ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster ASH1 and controls histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) on var genes, leads to expression of all vars. In another study focused on a novel chromatin-associated exoribonuclease, termed PfRNase II, Zhang et al. [63] revealed that this PfRNase II controls the silencing of upsA var genes, by marking their transcription start site and intron promoter regions leading to short-lived cryptic RNA. Depletion of PfRNase II specifically removes the silencing of upsA vars. Similarly, in the present study, knocking down of PfSWIB results in the silencing of upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB vars (Fig. 3 , Additional file 7: Figure S4 ). Therefore, PfSWIB might be one of the trans factors activating var genes, especially the upsA vars, and silencing partial upsB vars. In addition, a few var genes exhibited inconsistent RNA-seq results with qPCR, especially the upsA vars. They are more likely to be conditionally activated in the PfSWIB knockdown line, according to the RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 4 , Additional file 8: Figure  S5 ). The minor inconsistency between the RNA-seq and the qPCR results for partial vars could be due to false positives/negatives resulting from either of these two methods, or experimental variation caused by different parasite lines or other unidentified factors. Nevertheless, by comparing the log 2 fold change data from qPCR and RNA-seq on 44 var genes, we confirmed that the linear regression and linear correlation analysis showed a significant linear correlation between the two methods (r (44) =v0.6281, P < 0.0001) (Additional file 9: Figure S6) ."},{"ref_spans":[{"ref_id":"FIGREF4","start":806,"text":"(Fig. 5","end":813},{"ref_id":null,"start":836,"text":"Figure S7","end":845},{"ref_id":"FIGREF4","start":1143,"text":"(Fig. 5)","end":1151}],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF5","start":276,"text":"[6,","end":279},{"ref_id":"BIBREF6","start":280,"text":"7,","end":282},{"ref_id":"BIBREF9","start":283,"text":"10,","end":286},{"ref_id":"BIBREF10","start":287,"text":"11]","end":290},{"ref_id":"BIBREF5","start":485,"text":"[6,","end":488},{"ref_id":"BIBREF6","start":489,"text":"7]","end":491}],"section":"Discussion","text":"Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that var genes were highly expressed in the ring stage of P. falciparum, while drastically downregulated in the trophozoite stage. The var transcriptional levels in trophozoites are usually 10-100 times less than those in rings [6, 7, 10, 11] . A single P. falciparum parasite simultaneously transcribes multiple var genes but selects only one PfEMP-1 to attain the surface of the host cell by way of a developmentally regulated process [6, 7] . In order to test whether the transcription pattern had been disrupted when knocking down PfSWIB, we subsequently compared the transcription level of selected var genes between ring and trophozoite stage parasites, by testing the log 2 fold change of T/R in each group during a single life-cycle of P. falciparum (Fig. 5 , Additional file 11: Figure S7 ). Strikingly, we discovered that most of the upsA, upsB and upsC vars were downregulated in PfSWIB and 3D7 lines, while virtually all the upsA vars and partial upsB/upsC vars were significantly upregulated at the trophozoite-stage of the PfSWIB∆ line within the third life-cycle of P. falciparum (Fig. 5) , suggesting that PfSWIB might be involved in temporal regulation of var genes, particularly group A vars.

In the process of monoallelic expression, specific silent var genes are usually retained at unique perinuclear sites and relocated to transcriptionally active zones [21, 28] . Nuclear actin has been discovered complexed with PfSET10, which has been suggested to play a role in the movement of the locus during activation and heterochromatic silencing [26, 29] . Actin and actin-related proteins (Arps) are common components of chromatin remodeling complexes and are involved in nuclear positioning. According to biological characteristics, PfSWIB may be involved in the process of relocating episomes, as an actin-dependent regulator of chromatin. Further studies regarding the possible role of PfSWIB and actin interaction would be worthwhile."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Conclusions","text":"In the present study, we revealed that actin-related chromatin remodeling factor PfSWIB is involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and is crucial for the survival and growth of the Plasmodium parasite. Depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes and removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes, but also leads to the aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-hour life-cycle. These findings could provide a better understanding of the regulatory function of PfCRCs in regulating the clonal variation of the var gene family contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites."}],"back_matter":[{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Acknowledgments","text":"We thank the staff at the Department of Tropical Diseases, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.

incidence of health-care-associated infection (HCAI) caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria has gradually risen during the last decade, especially in immunocompromised patients. 1, 2 The most common causative agents of HCAI in the United States are the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus. 3 Methicillin (oxacillin)resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is of particular concern because patients with MRSA infection tend to have higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, and higher health-careassociated costs than patients with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections. 1, 4 In addition, DiazGranados et al 5 found that the mortality rate among patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs) infection was significantly higher than that among patients with vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus infections. Taiwan is no exception, and VRE and MRSA infections have become emerging infectious diseases. 6e10 Antibiotic use is one of the risk factors for antibiotic resistance among bacterial species; however, the nature of this relationship is complicated. Although several studies have examined the relationship between antimicrobial consumption and antibiotic resistance, the findings were inconsistent, possibly due to differences in resistance profiles as well as due to differences in antibiotic-prescribing practices in different countries. 11e18 In those studies, the use of glycopeptides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones was demonstrated to be associated with the prevalence of MRSA and VRE. 12e18 Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between the use of linezolid or fusidic acid and the prevalence of MRSA and VRE. In addition, the association between the consumption of tigecycline, a novel anti-Gram-positive agent derived from minocycline that has been shown to be effective against many Gram-negative rods as well as Gram-positive cocci, and the prevalence of MRSA and VRE has never been studied. 19 Similarly, no studies have so far investigated the association between the prevalence of MRSA and VRE and the consumption of daptomycin, an anti-MRSA antibiotic that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections and bacteremia due to MRSA. 20, 21 In this study, we investigated the correlation between consumption of antibiotics, including vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, tigecycline, fusidic acid, and daptomycin, and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA and HCAI-VRE during the period from 2000 to 2010 at a medical center in Taiwan."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF15","start":518,"text":"16,","end":521},{"ref_id":"BIBREF16","start":522,"text":"17","end":524},{"ref_id":"BIBREF21","start":923,"text":"22","end":925},{"ref_id":"BIBREF21","start":1019,"text":"22","end":1021},{"ref_id":"BIBREF21","start":1250,"text":"22,","end":1253},{"ref_id":null,"start":1254,"text":"23","end":1256},{"ref_id":"BIBREF21","start":1474,"text":"22","end":1476}],"section":"Hospital setting","text":"The National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) is a 2500bed, academically affiliated medical center that provides both primary and tertiary care in northern Taiwan.

In addition, we noted a negative correlation between the use of teicoplanin and linezolid and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA.

Although we found a significant correlation between antibiotic use and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA, the etiology behind the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in our hospital is complicated and selective pressure from widespread use of antimicrobial agents might be only one of the causes. The prevalence of MRSA could have been affected by multiple factors such as infection-control measures and hand hygiene, or operational changes in the hospital. After the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the infection prevention and control program at the NTUH was upgraded to include hand hygiene, antibiotic-control policies, and an annual, intensive, project-based control program. In fact, it has been demonstrated that those policies are directly associated with the decrease in rates of HCAIs and bloodstream infections at the NTUH. 25 However, those effects were not measured in this study. Whether those policies had an impact on MRSA trends remains unknown. In addition, because this was an epidemiological surveillance study, we did not analyze the impact that duration of exposure to antibiotics, or clonal spread of resistant bacteria had on the trend in incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection. Furthermore, the overall DDD of a given antibiotic is a notoriously problematic denominator as there will be changes in low-dose usage in specific groups of patients (i.e., children and patients with renal insufficiency). Therefore, an analysis using number of prescriptions for those patient groups would be more appropriate. However, the impact should be limited in this study because those specific patient groups comprised only a small fraction of the study patients and the effect would be diluted and equal in each year."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Discussion","text":"In conclusion, in this 11-year study in a single medical institution, we found that the use of teicoplanin and linezolid significantly increased.

Sequenced isolates from a market in UAE showed lineage 272 switching from week to week which is also supportive of rapid reinfection or coinfection in 273 calves (65).274Longitudinal studies also indicated that maternally acquired immunity may offer some 275 protection. In both studies of calf-mother-pairs conducted in UAE, MERS-CoV infection 276 became highly prevalent in calves between 4-6 months of age when maternally-acquired277 antibody titres had waned (62, 79). Samples from reinfected animals have been found to have 278 lower viral loads, suggesting that past infection may ameliorate future infections (76). Viral 279 load and probability of isolating infectious virus were greater when sampling calves, than 280 adults (44, 79). 281 Discussion 282 The results of our systematic review show that MERS-CoV circulates widely in dromedaries 283 across the Middle East and Africa, but transmission varies spatially, and temporally. The sub-national range of MERS-CoV seroprevalence appears to be larger in countries outside of the 285 Arabian Peninsula. Within-country variation in seroprevalence is potentially indicative of 286 differences in transmission dynamics, meaning vaccine strategy evaluation and mathematical 287 modelling will need to be conducted at a sub-national resolution. 288 The rise of MERS-CoV seroprevalence from 40-90% in juveniles, to 80-100% in adult 289 dromedaries across much of West, North and East Africa and the Middle East, is signature of 290 an endemic disease where the probability of infection increases with time. High 291 seroprevalence in calves <1-year-old in some populations in UAE and KSA suggests high 292 transmission intensity in the Arabian Peninsula, with most dromedaries becoming infected 293 during the first year of life, though maternally acquired antibodies may contribute to 294 seropositivity in young calves(48, 62, 63). The age-dependent seroprevalence values 295 synthesised here should be used to fit models of MERS-CoV transmission in dromedaries and 296 elucidate the likely transmission intensity of the virus in the Middle East and in Africa -a 297 key parameter for estimating vaccination impact. Reporting finer age stratification of young 298 dromedaries would allow a better comparison of transmission intensity in different regions 299 through fitting models of seroconversion. 300 Despite locally-acquired human cases predominantly being reported within the Arabian 301 Peninsula, the major unilateral trade of camels from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian 302 Peninsula (80) means that the endemicity of MERS-CoV in African dromedary populations 303 has implications for the scope of control programs. Viruses isolated in Africa (Egypt, 304 Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and most recently Kenya) have all been classified 305 into Clade C (with West African isolates comprising sub-clade C1(81)), while only Clades A 306 and B have been isolated in the Arabian Peninsula (27, 43, 53, 81). Spike region sequences 307 from Pakistan are similar to those from the Arabian Peninsula (57). Further investigation of 308 the geographical restrictions of MERS-CoV clades would help clarify the extent to which 309 MERS-CoV circulates intercontinentally.","type":"figure"},"FIGREF1":{"latex":null,"text":"conducted in wholesale markets in KSA, saw lower rates infection during July and August, 248 and higher positivity in December (51).

Calf-focused vaccination may reduce the overall number of dromedary316    infections but, the reduced risk of exposure would mean that any remaining infections would 317 likely occur at an older age than in the absence of vaccination. It will therefore be important 318 to further investigate the age-dependency of human-dromedary contact patterns and how 319 these vary in different countries and husbandry systems. Vaccination strategies should be 320 evaluated, not only on their likely impact on prevalence of active infection in dromedaries, 321 but also on the age-distribution of infections.322Mapping the movement of dromedaries is necessary to understand the underlying spatial323 transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV. The mixing of dromedaries underpins interaction 324 between infectious and susceptible individuals and therefore the dynamics of MERS-CoV 325 transmission. Live markets and abattoirs which both had higher prevalence of RNA shedding 326 compared to other site-types in multiple studies, are key locations for animal mixing(23, 28, 327 51, 64). Quantitative data describing the movement and trading patterns of dromedary 328 populations will be essential for informing models and considering where potential 329 vaccination should take place. A role for markets as drivers of disease dissemination is 330 characteristic of other zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza (82, 83).331 Move evidence is required to establish whether MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries is 332 seasonal. The temporal studies in this review observed a peak in prevalence of active 333 infection between December and June (29, 49-51). These were conducted in Egypt and KSA 334 where dromedary calving occurs between October and February (84-86), and Nigeria which 335 has a similar calving season (87). Assuming seasonal calving was driving the trend, and to peak between January and May -which overlaps with the peaks 338 observed. If infection is driven by seasonal calving vaccination would need to occur annually 339 prior to the infection of newly susceptible calves. Based on phylogenetic analysis of MERS-340 CoV genomes isolated from humans and dromedaries, a seasonal period of elevated risk of 341 zoonotic transmission was estimated to exist from April through to July (6), however, this is 342 not seen consistently in the epidemiology of primary human MERS-CoV cases reported to 343 WHO (88). Further investigation of potential seasonality has been highlighted as a priority by 344 the FAO-OIE-WHO MERS-CoV Technical Working Group (2). 345 The results of longitudinal studies included in this review demonstrate re-infection of 346 dromedaries despite high titres of MERS-CoV specific antibodies being present in their sera. 347 Unfortunately, the degree and duration of protection afforded by maternally-acquired 348 antibodies and those acquired from infection is unclear. Informative surveys of a better proxy 349 for protective immunity in dromedaries would improve the accuracy of models of reinfection 350 and the likely effects of vaccination.","type":"figure"},"TABREF2":{"latex":null,"text":"report RNA prevalence from the same study 141 j. unclear whether study found negative camels -it only mentions that 6 camels were tested, found positive and viral genomes were isolated 142 •neutralisation test limited to a subset of samples or only used to detect presence of high titres 143 ** No positivity cut-off titre given but all samples had incredibly high titres, and were able to neutralise at dilution >1:1280","type":"table"},"TABREF6":{"latex":null,"text":"extraction. The available studies exhibit differences in study design, criteria for seropositivity, sample-site type and sample population characteristics. Some studies report that the latter two variables are associated with statistically significant differences in seroprevalence or prevalence of infection within individual studies(23, 29, 30, 39, 40, 51,   64). These heterogeneities made quantitative pooling inappropriate.Available studies do not include camel dense regions of northern Africa or Rajasthan, India, and Yemen. In addition to the countries included in this systematic review of the published literature, OIE has received reports of RNA positive camels in Iran andKuwait (90, 91).Members at WHO and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations) confirm that further RNA testing studies are planned or underway in several countries in Africa (e.g. Ethiopia, Kenya, Egypt, Somalia, Sudan, Algeria and Morocco) and in the Middle East (e.g. Jordan), as well as countries in South East Asia (e.g. Pakistan) (personal communication, Maria D. Van Kerkhove). Our findings provide strong evidence that MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary populations across much of West, North, East Africa and the Middle East, in agreement with the similar systematic review conducted in parallel with our own (11). Calves are likely to play a central role in sustaining circulation of MERS-CoV and should be a target of potential dromedary vaccination. However, the potential for mass vaccination of calves to change the age distribution of infected individuals should be investigated through mathematical modelling of transmission dynamics in dromedary populations and considered in the context of agedependent human-camel contact frequency patterns. Sites where dromedaries mix may also play a role in driving transmission. A better understanding of dromedary husbandry and trade patterns, as well as quarantine facilities, is needed to identify where dromedaries are infected with MERS-CoV -critical for focussing potential vaccination strategies. Although in a few studies, prevalence of infection appears to peak in the first half of the year, which may be facilitated by the increase in susceptible animals after the calving season, further studies are needed to confirm this. Further longitudinal studies are required to investigate the temporal dynamics of viral shedding and immunity in the animal host and should ideally be capable of distinguishing co-circulating MERS-CoV lineages. These remaining gaps in our understanding of MERS-CoV transmission dynamics in dromedary populations agree with the prioritized research outlined in the FAO-OIE-WHO Technical Working group report(2)and must be addressed to obtain a clearer picture of what an optimal vaccination strategy would involve, as well as its likely impact, beforeMiguel  E, Chevalier V, Ayelet G, Ben Bencheikh MN, Boussini H, Chu DK, et al.

The IU also describes how the results are reported: qualitative assays most often report whether a specific pathogen is detected or not (eg, culture or direct antigen tests); less commonly (for respiratory pathogens), the results may be quantitative (eg, viral load assays or antibody titers)."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Intended Use","text":"The specimen type (also referred to as the sample matrix) that can be tested is also an important component of the IU of the device.

FDA recognizes two major situations for assessing the diagnostic performance of new qualitative diagnostic tests: when a clinical reference method is available or when a comparator other than a reference method is used. In the former circumstance, a clinical reference method is considered to be the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target organism [1] but the reference method cannot incorporate results reported by the new device; for example, a new enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) could not be used as one of the diagnostic criteria for the reference method in a study used to evaluate the performance of the assay. Confusion may sometimes arise when distinguishing between analytical and clinical reference method since these may be identical or separate in different contexts; for example, the performance characteristics for a new assay for group A streptococcus against an analytical reference method such as culture on appropriate media may only be valid in the clinical setting of pharyngitis, since group A streptococcus may be a normal colonizer and performance may be different in the setting of colonization versus infection. In contrast, the analytical and clinical reference methods for influenza A are identical since the presence of influenza A is always considered abnormal. Determining the appropriate clinical reference methods may be particularly complex in the setting of multiplex assays for diseases with multiple etiologies such as community-acquired pneumonia, and where two or more possible pathogens may be isolated."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF3","start":865,"text":"[4]","end":868},{"ref_id":"BIBREF1","start":1059,"text":"[3]","end":1062}],"section":"Reference Methods and Clinical Studies","text":"Newly identified organisms introduce different challenges in selecting the appropriate reference method; for example, more recently identified pathogens such as metapneumovirus may be difficult to isolate or confirm by traditional methods such as culture.

Similar concerns exist for assays that differentiate subtypes of novel influenza, a disease where diagnostics are essential but where relatively few clinical specimens are available for confirming performance. There are recent FDA guidances that are useful in aiding companies in developing valid comparators.

Low test sensitivity reflects less security with the results of a negative test; that is, patients with the disease may be falsely labeled as negative by the new assay. (This fundamental consideration, i.e., -equating ''analyte not detected'' with the absence of disease [or the analyte]-is a common misinterpretation that bedevils the clinical use of devices with imperfect sensitivity.). Specificity is the converse; that is, the probability that the new device will have a negative test result given that the clinical reference method is negative. Specificity is estimated in the pivotal study by the fraction of subjects that are negative by the new test among those that are negative by the clinical reference method. Higher specificity yields greater confidence in a positive result. It is important to recognize that although patients included in specificity calculations do not have the disease of interest, in most cases they are still symptomatic (depending on the specific IU for the test); asymptomatic subjects would not be considered part of the IU population for such a device and therefore would not be appropriate for use in a specificity calculation."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF0","start":696,"text":"[1]","end":699}],"section":"Assay Interpretation","text":"There are examples where a new device is not compared with a reference but to a previously cleared/approved device.

Identical statistical calculations can be used in this setting but are interpreted as being positive and negative percent agreement rather than sensitivity and specificity; these considerations are also described in FDA guidance [1] .

In a clinical study with only 5 specimens positive for a specific pathogen (via the reference method) and an observed sensitivity of 5/5 (100%) results in a lower confidence bound of only 55.6%, meaning diagnostic performance is very uncertain. Even for a test with perfect sensitivity, at least 35 patients with the condition of interest would be needed to yield a 95% lower bound greater than 90%.

Was Kommunen tun können In Städten werden große Mengen an Treibhausgasen in den Bereichen Energie, Gebäude, Verkehr sowie Gewerbe und Industrie ausgestoßen. Um das Klima zu schützen, spielen Kommunen daher eine wichtige Rolle. Rund ein Viertel der Kommunen in Deutschland gilt allerdings schon seit Jahren als finanzschwach. Dass gerade auch diese Städte und Gemeinden Spielräume für Klimaschutzinvestitionen haben und davon regionalökonomisch profitieren können, zeigen eine neue Broschüre und fünf ergänzende Infoblätter vom Deutschen Institut für Urbanistik Beim Ernten der frischen Kakaofrüchte wird meist wenig auf Umwelt und Gesundheit der Kleinbauern geachtet. Das soll sich mit Hilfe des Projektes ändern Kommunen -setzen nicht nur einen fachübergreifenden und strategischen Dialog zwischen Umwelt-, Bau-und Finanzdezernaten in den jeweiligen Städten voraus. Städte müssen auch offensiv in den Dialog mit den für sie zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörden der jeweiligen Bundesländer treten\", sagt Corinna Altenburg vom Difu. Die Broschüre und die Infoblätter helfen (finanzschwachen) Kommunen über Anfangshürden bei der Projektarbeit für den Klimaschutz hinweg. Sie zeigen Beispiele aus der kommunalen Praxis auf und verweisen auf umfangreiche weiterführende Informationen. So können sich interessierte Akteur*innen aus Kommunen etwa über die Finanzierung und Umsetzung von Maßnahmen informieren. Rolle und Handlungsbereiche von Kommunen im Klimaschutz. (Difu-eigene Darstellung, erweitert und ergänzt in Anlehnung an Difu 2017) Die unzähligen Proben und Daten von der einjährigen Drift seien ein Geschenk an die ganze Menschheit. Jetzt komme es darauf an, das neue Wissen zu nutzen, um richtige Entscheidungen zu treffen -für die Zukunft der Arktis und für die Zukunft unseres Planeten. Gesunde Nahrungsmittel, Biodiversitätsschutz, Nitratbelastung -viel wurde in den letzten Jahren über die Probleme in der Landwirtschaft diskutiert und über mögliche Lösungsansätze gestritten. Innovative und akzeptierte Lösungen sind gefragt, die alle Akteure mit einbeziehen -was nicht zuletzt die Aktivitäten von Fridays for Future oder die Proteste von Landwirt*innen gegen die politische Verschärfung der Umweltauflagen Anfang dieses Jahres gezeigt haben. Hier knüpfen die \"Agrarsysteme der Zukunft\" an, eine Förderinitiative des Bundesforschungsministeriums ( BMBF). Acht inter-und transdisziplinäre Forschungskonsortien suchen nach Antworten und verfolgen dabei zum Teil auch unkonventionelle Lösungsansätze für die Zukunft der Landwirtschaft. Vorausgegangen war der \"Zukunftsprozess Agrarsysteme -Ideen für eine lebenswerte Zukunft\" ab 2015, mit dem der Startschuss für das Förderformat und die Identifikation relevanter Forschungs-und Innovationsfelder erfolgte. Beim offenen \"Wettbewerb der Visionen\" kamen Akteure aus Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft und Politik zusammen, um Ideen und Zukunftsbilder für zukünftige Agrarsysteme zu diskutieren. Auf der Grundlage von Zukunftsvisionen und weiteren inhaltlichen Arbeiten entstand die 2016 veröffentlichte BMBF-Fördermaßnahme.Viele Wege -ein gemeinsames ZielDie acht geförderten Forschungskonsortien befassen sich mit unterschiedlichen Themenbereichen von Ernährung der Zukunft über Landwirtschaft 4.0, Grünlandnutzung bis hin zu stadtregionalen Kreisläufen. Dabei verbinden sie nicht nur unterschiedliche wissenschaftliche Disziplinen, sondern beziehen auch eine große Bandbreite verschiedener Praxisakteure mit ein. Um den Transfer aus der Wissenschaft in die Praxis zu erproben, haben die Projekte konkrete Umsetzungsschritte vorgesehen, in denen die wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse direkt zur Anwendung kommen. Dabei verteilen sich die Projekte über ganz Deutschland und decken somit auch unterschiedliche naturräumliche Gegebenheiten ab.Die Konsortien arbeiten in unterschiedlichen räumlichen Kontexten. Die Projekte \"Fahrerkabine 4.0\" und \"NOcsPS\" stellen das Wirtschaften in ländlichen Räumen in den Mittelpunkt. Fahrerkabine 4.0 untersucht, wie eine smarte Fahrerkabine bei Landmaschinen die hohe Arbeitsbelastung der Landwirt*innen verringern kann. Das Projekt NOcsPS setzt sich mit der Verknüpfung von ökologischem und konventionellem Landbau auseinander. Gesucht wird nach modifizierten Ackerbausystemen, um in Zukunft auf den Einsatz von chemisch-synthetischen Pflanzenschutzmitteln verzichten zu können. Auch urbane Räume sind ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Untersuchungen. So werden bei \" CUBES-Circle\" nicht nur besonders für Städte geeignete, in sich geschlossene modulare Anbausysteme erprobt, in \"food4future\" werden auch mögliche Produktionssysteme für die Kultivierung alternativer Nahrungsquellen wie Makroalgen, Halophyten (salztolerante Pflanzen), Medusen (Quallen) und Grillen erforscht.Die Projekte \" RUN\" und \" SUSKULT\" schlagen eine Brücke zwischen diesen beiden Räumen und wollen Kreisläufe schließen, indem sie die in urbanen Räumen entstehenden Nährstoffe für die Nahrungsmittelproduktion nutzbar machen. Dabei geht es auf der einen Seite um die Gewinnung von Nährstoffen aus Bioabfällen und Abwasserströmen, während auf der anderen Seite die entstehenden Ressourcen einer Kläranlage für eine angrenzende Agrarproduktion zugänglich gemacht werden sollen.Neben physischen Räumen spielen auch virtuelle Räume eine wichtige Rolle. Mit Hilfe innovativer Tierlenktechnologie bringt das Projekt \"Green-Gras\" virtuelle und physische Räume zusammen. Ermöglicht werden soll das Hüten von Weidetiere ohne Zäune, um die Weidehaltung langfristig wieder attraktiver für Landwirt*innen zu machen. Das Projekt \" DAKIS\" bewegt sich im virtuellen Raum, indem es ein digitales Wissens-undInformationssystem für die Landwirtschaft erarbeitet. Das System, das Echtzeitdaten mit Simulationen, gesellschaftlichen Bedarfen und betriebsökonomischen Faktoren kombiniert, soll in Zukunft Ökosystemleistungen optimal für die Gesellschaft bereitstellen können. So entstehen neue Kommunikationswege für eine Kooperation zwischen Landwirt*innen, Verbraucher*innen und der Gesellschaft. Die Projekte untersuchen unterschiedliche Formen von Produktions-und Reproduktionsräumen. Somit geht es nicht nur um die unterschiedlichen Produktionsformen von Nahrungsmitteln, sondern auch um vielfältige Möglichkeiten der Wiedernutzung von Nährstoffen. Die Etablierung und dauerhafte Umsetzung von Kreislaufwirtschaftssystemen bildet hier die konzeptionelle Grundlage. \"Die Agrarsysteme der Zukunft bieten neue Perspektiven und Ansätze für ein zukunftsweisende Landwirtschaft und eine nachhaltige Bioökonomie\" so Prof. Monika Schreier, Teil der Koordinierungsstelle und Koordinatorin des Projekts food4future. Dabei steht der Weg von der innovativen Idee bis hin zur Umsetzung im Zentrum der Projekte. Wesentlich sind hierfür interund transdisziplinäre Formen der Zusammenarbeit. Die Aktivitäten stehen dabei ganz im Zeichen der diesjährig verabschiedeten nationalen Bioökonomiestrategie der Bundesregierung, gezielt nachhaltige Lösungen zu entwickeln, die Ressourcen schonen und gleichzeitig Wohlstand schaffen.

V. untersucht im Rahmen einer Nachwuchsforschergruppe, wie sich Konflikte zwischen Wildtieren und Menschen in der Landwirtschaft reduzieren lassen. In der Zeitschrift \"Conservation Biology\" stellen ZALF-Forschende nun einen Bewertungsrahmen vor, der Behörden und Politik im Umgang mit dem Wolf besser unterstützen soll.Landwirtschaftlich genutzte Flächen sind immer auch Lebensraum. Wenn Wildtiere auf Feldern ihre Nahrung suchen oder Nutztiere auf Weiden reißen, kann das für landwirtschaftliche Betriebe zum Problem werden. Das konfliktträchtigste Beispiel ist wohl der Wolf. Mehr als 100 Rudel sind seit dem Jahr 2000 wieder in Deutschland heimisch. Die Wissenschaftler*innen der Nachwuchsforschungsgruppe \"Mensch-Wildtierkonflikte in Agrarlandschaften\" am ZALF wollen herausfinden, wie sich in der Landwirtschaft das Risiko für durch Wildtiere verursachte Schäden vermeiden lässt. In Zusammenarbeit mit Forschungseinrichtungen aus Deutschland, Tansania und Kanada hat die Gruppe um den Leiter Dr. Hannes König einen wissenschaftlichen Bewertungsrahmen erarbeitet, der dabei unterstützen soll, durch Wölfe verursachte Schäden zukünftig besser einzuschätzen und Entscheidungshilfen für geeignete Maßnahmen bereitzustellen.","type":"table"},"TABREF1":{"latex":null,"text":"Mail: steffen.lange@ioew.de.

Sie stellen Kommunen spätestens dann vor die Frage, wie mit ihnen umzugehen ist, wenn Investitionen in marode technische Infrastrukturen wie Straßen, Kanalisation oder Trinkwasserleitungen nicht mehr aufzuschieben sind. Hohe Kosten stehen dann den wenigen verbliebenen Einwohner*innen gegenüber. Wäre es in dieser Situation vorstellbar, dass die Ge-Fokus: das Bauund Planungsrecht, die Kosten eines Rückzugs sowie die sozialen und emotionalen Aspekte in der Gemeinde. Vier grundsätzliche Handlungsoptionen wurden herausgearbeitet: kein strategischer Rückzug, also der Erhalt des Ortsteiles; ein sehr langsamer strategischer Rückzug; ein forcierter, vollständiger Rückzug sowie ein forcierter, aber nur teilweiser Rückzug. Letzterer würde voraussetzen, dass die verbleibenden Einwohner*innen die Infrastrukturen wie Straßen, Abwasseranlagen und Müllentsorgung in privater Trägerschaft, etwa in Form einer Genossenschaft, übernehmen. Die Vor-und Nachteile der vier Optionen wurden im Planspiel und in einem Begleitkreis ausführlich diskutiert. Einige Spielgruppen entschieden sich tatsächlich für einen vollständigen Rückzug. Allerdings herrschte bei einzelnen Teilnehmenden auch Skepsis, ob sich ein solches Vorgehen in der Realität wirklich kommunalpolitisch umsetzen ließe. Die Diskussionen zu den verschiedenen Rückzugsoptionen werden in einer Handreichung für Kommunen nun ausführlich dargestellt, Vor-und Nachteile sowie wichtige Voraussetzungen beleuchtet. Auch zu den Kosten eines strategischen Siedlungsrückzugs enthält die Broschüre Informationen. Sie spielen eine wichtige Rolle, sind doch hohe Pro-Kopf-Kosten für Infrastrukturen häufig Auslöser und wichtige Leerstand und wenig Entwicklungsperspektive -wann ist ein Siedlungsrückzug sinnvoll? Begründung eines strategischen Rückzugs. Doch das Planspiel hat auch gezeigt: Mittelfristig können die Kosten für den strategischen Rückzug diejenigen für den Erhalt des Ortsteiles sogar übersteigen. Ein wichtiger Punkt in der Diskussion zum Thema ist deshalb auch die Frage nach geeigneten Rechts-und Förderinstrumenten vonseiten des Gesetzgebers. Das Projekt-Team empfiehlt, das vorhandene Instrumentarium hin zu einem Instrument \"Ländlicher Umbau\" weiterzuentwickeln. Die namentliche Anlehnung an das Instrumentarium zum Stadtumbau sei dabei bewusst gewählt, denn viele Herausforderungen und Lösungspfade ähnelten sich in Stadt und Land. Bei der Entwicklung von Rechts-und Förderinstrumenten müssten aber auch die Besonderheiten der ländlichen Räume, etwa der hohe Anteil selbstgenutzten Eigentums, berücksichtigt werden. Weitere Erkenntnisse aus dem MORO-Planspiel, die es zu berücksichtigen gilt: Ein strategischer Rückzug ist keine Sofortmaßnahme, sondern braucht Zeit -im Vorlauf, in der Vorbereitung und in der Umsetzung. Das Thema ist äußerst komplex, betroffene Kommunen benötigen daher oft umfassende fachliche Unterstützung. Nicht zuletzt handelt es sich um ein hochemotionales Thema. Eine umfassende Beteiligung der betroffenen Menschen vor Ort und eine transparente Gestaltung des Prozesses sind daher äußerst wichtig.Studie belegt: Bisher

Sans Frontières (MSF) is one of the world's leading humanitarian medical organizations. It provides emergency medical assistance to populations in danger in more than 70 countries. The foundational and animating values of MSF as a humanitarian medical organization are rooted in ethics [1] . Historically, research was not seen as core to the mission of MSF. However, during its history, MSF has constantly developed innovative protocols and tools, in response to unmet field needs [2] . It now initiates, sponsors or participates in numerous research projects in multiple field sites. In 2013 alone, 253 research papers were published [3] . The results of MSF research have had substantial impact on global health policy and provide benefits to populations served by MSF and elsewhere as presented later in this paper. MSF has also shown leadership in operational research initiatives in the humanitarian NGO sector [4] . As a result, research has become increasingly integral to MSF activities, both in the field and in global health advocacy. The increased emphasis on research led to the creation of an ethics review board (ERB) in 2001. From the outset independence of the ERB from the organisation was perceived as essential. To avoid conflict of interest and ensure independence, ERB members cannot have a working relationship with MSF during their tenure. The ERB has now been in place for thirteen years. The ERB's dialogue with MSF has enhanced sensitivities towards research ethics and lead to gradual improvements in developing ethically sound proposals. The consistent use of an ethics framework has helped in standardizing the review process and guiding field research teams in addressing ethical issues. The way that the ERB functions and the challenging ethical issues addressed by the ERB since its inception have been described previously [5] . The ERB strives to take a constructive approach to both research proposals and the field of research ethics itself.

Much of current research ethics practice lacks an empirical basis, and many recommended standards are based on historical practice. From our perspective, research ethics and research ethics practices are capable of being examined through research and a quality improvement approach. Any genuine ethics review requires critical reflection and discussion, not the pedestrian adoption of legalistic rules, and it should result in a learning process for both the researchers and the reviewers. Fostering a spirit of innovation and evaluation in research ethics practice demonstrates that research ethics itself is an active and essential component of global health research.

Since its inception, the volume of ERB activity has increased considerably, as reflected in the number of protocols received. Overall 248 research protocols were reviewed by the ERB between 2002 and 2013 with an almost ten-fold increase in the number of protocols across that period ( Figure 2 ). Protocols are always submitted to the ERB and to the Ethics Committees in the study country, and the approval from the local Ethics Committee is a fundamental prerequisite to the ERB approval. In very rare instances, the ERB may waive this request if, for example, no ethics committee or national body able to play a similar function is available, or if it is justified not to collaborate with the legal authorities, as this could be detrimental to the population served by MSF (e.g. working in a conflict zone with a population group persecuted by national authorities)."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"ERB performance","text":"In 2010-2011, 56 requests for review were received in 24 months.

An audit of proposals from 2010-2013 (four-year period) demonstrated an average time to approval of twelve weeks (Figure 3) . Figure 3 shows that, on average, the ERB needs more time for doing the first review (time between MSF request and finalizing ERB review) than researchers for responding (time between ERB review and MSF reply) in the case of expedited review. However, the ERB is faster than the investigators in case of full review. Once a satisfactory reply and revisions from the researchers are received, approval is usually granted quickly. Overall the procedure is faster for expedited review than for full review. This is mainly due to the fact that proposals submitted for expedited review are judged to be of minimal risk of harm, that study design is often less complex and that a smaller number of reviewers is involved. Assessing the timeline of the review procedure is a relevant indicator of ERB performance and dispels the myth that the ERB is responsible for a slow review process. Also, the overall time to approval should not be seen as the \"time to getting a stamp\", but as a time of dialogue and critical reflection on both sides. In addition, ERB timelines are shortened in case of extraordinarily urgent situations and turnaround can occur within a few days."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"ERB performance","text":"To further improve its decentralized and very reactive way of functioning, a web-based platform was created exclusively for the MSF ERB.

First, it seeks to articulate and make explicit the kinds of values or other ethical considerations that are taken to be of crucial importance in relation to the topic in hand, in this case, the ethics of research conducted in the course of humanitarian medicine. Any framework will be the product of a particular time, influenced by the knowledge and experience of those involved in producing it. Articulating the considerations that are held to be relevant allows for transparent discussion, critique and development of the framework over time in the light of evolving situations. Second, and perhaps most crucially, an ethics framework provides assistance to researchers and others that evaluate and/or make decisions about the ethics of research. This means that a framework will often be an aid to research design and deliberation, not just a theoretical expression of ideals. On this view, it ought to be of use to members of the ethics board, but also of aid to researchers and anyone else thinking about the relevant issues (as the document is publicly available on the MSF website [7] ). Third, it is also important to recognise what a framework does not do. It does not, for example, determine what should or should not be done. It is not a piece of legal or quasi-legal regulation. Rather, its intent is clearly expressed by the metaphor of 'framing'; it aims to 'frame' , or provide an outline or structure for a focused and relevant discussion and eventual decision, not to provide a list of necessary and absolute principles or statements."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF7","start":354,"text":"[8]","end":357},{"ref_id":"BIBREF8","start":358,"text":"[9]","end":361},{"ref_id":"BIBREF9","start":362,"text":"[10]","end":366}],"section":"A new framework to guide ethics review","text":"The original MSF ERB framework was based on the work of Emanuel et al.

The Emanuel framework seemed to synthesize these diverse guidelines into something tangible. Despite its limitations briefly described below, it provided a focus for both reviewers and researchers.

First, and perhaps most importantly, the Emanuel framework actually provides little practical guidance. It is more of a checklist of important considerations than a framework that facilitates making ethical judgments. For example, the framework is structured in terms of a series of ethical 'principles' and related 'benchmarks'. However, it is unclear what a benchmark is. How do the different 'benchmarks' relate to each other? What is the moral status of a benchmark? Is it an ethical principle, a value or just a statement? What practical priority is to be given to each principle or benchmark? How do the different principles and benchmarks relate to each other and what should we do if they conflict? Is the presented order of the principles and benchmarks important or not? For example, the old framework's first stated 'principle' is 'Collaborative Partnership' , followed by 'Social Value' and then 'Scientific Validity'. In what sense are these supposed to be principles? They might be things that researchers and the ERB are supposed to 'take into account' , but how do they do this? Is \"Collaborative Partnership\" the most important 'principle'? Is that why it is first? Emanuel et al. [8] suggest that their requirements are presented in chronological order, although the detail of the order could be questioned. For example, why is a procedural requirement (independent review) in the list, and why does it appear where it does? Why is informed consent prior to, and separate from, respect for potential and enrolled subjects? If we consider the 'benchmarks' the first thing that is noticeable is that they are very didactic ( Table 1) ."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF10","start":1445,"text":"[11,","end":1449},{"ref_id":"BIBREF11","start":1450,"text":"12]","end":1453}],"section":"A new framework to guide ethics review","text":"The benchmarks state what should happen in a firm and clear way. There is a mixture of useful advice about engaging with local communities and researchers, although it remains unclear why this should be done. Is it for practical reasons e.g., because this is the best way to get the study results? Or is it for ethical reasons? If so, it is unclear what they might be, especially as 'collaborative partnership' is not an ethical principle. For example, you might expect some possible commitment to ideas of respect, or equality and justice. Second, the benchmarks are not always helpful. For example, consider the benchmark: 'Respect the community's values, culture, traditions, and social practices'. What does this mean? Does this relate to the kinds of issues just mentioned, such as a commitment to equal respect and value of persons? Are we to take it literally as a general didactic statement? Is it a commitment to some form of relativism? Are we to commit ourselves to engage with and effectively endorse any existing injustices in the population of study? If women have a marginalised role in that society, should we 'respect' this? At the very least, these are complex matters where the benchmarks often fail to capture the nuances relevant to thinking about ethics. Similar kinds of questions can be asked of many other research ethics frameworks and guidelines, as it is often left obscure how they are to be used as practical tools [11, 12] . Second, the academic literature and debates have proliferated and developed over the last ten years, especially in relation to post-research benefits for host populations. Many of these discussions are of particular importance for research conducted by MSF. MSF as a medical organisation is providing health care to vulnerable and destitute populations and is devoting limited resources to research with the sole aim of improving health care. Third, there has been a growing awareness that the kind of research conducted by MSF may not be well served by traditional research ethics for several reasons: the chosen method is only rarely one of a randomised clinical trial of novel medicines (the model that has dominated research ethics) and is more likely to use retrospective analysis of previously collected clinical data, surveys, needs assessment or case control methods; the context for research is distinctive, in that much research is conducted in contexts of disaster, conflict, poverty, social exclusion and lack of access to care, disrupted health systems or other difficult circumstances, where there is great vulnerability and pressing humanitarian needs."},{"ref_spans":[{"ref_id":null,"start":818,"text":"Table 2","end":825}],"cite_spans":[],"section":"A new framework to guide ethics review","text":"We believe that the new ethics framework [13] is an improvement in a number of ways. First, the overall structure of the framework is clearer. The issues are now placed into three groups (Research Question and Methodology; Respecting and Protecting Research Participants and Communities; Implications and Implementation of the Research Findings) to reflect a logical temporal order of things to consider before, during and after the research has been conducted. Second, this structure and, in particular, the use of questions should aid deliberation by anyone using the framework. Formulating the content of the framework in terms of questions very deliberately 'frames' the discussion about research ethics. It provides an open and flexible approach, rather than seeking to articulate a number of general statements. Table 2 illustrates this by focusing on the issue of informed consent."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"A new framework to guide ethics review","text":"The old framework sets out a set of commands as if they were absolute rules that must be followed. The new framework covers much of the same ground, but approaches the issues in a different spirit. It seeks to invite researchers to justify their approach. It accepts that sometimes it is inappropriate or impossible to gain a fully informed consent from every individual. Help is offered to the researcher, but the aim is to encourage a conversation about ethical issues, rather than impose quasi-legalistic rules. The questions help potential researchers to see what the ERB wishes to see in a protocol and ethics application, but can also help researchers come to understand ethical issues in more detail, and how ethical issues are intertwined with methodological issues. The use of open questions requires researchers to engage with the framework and outline and defend how they will address the relevant issues that they have identified. Ethics review is more of an active process, with the researcher as a participant, rather than the victim of an alien and abstract set of rules. Third, the new framework is more engaged with the specific MSF research context. This means that certain values/principles/issues are given much greater prominence than they ever have before. For example, it is now much clearer how methodological and ethical issues interact and the obligations that arise once research has been completed are much more prominent and require greater attention b ."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"A new framework to guide ethics review","text":"The new framework has been implemented since November 2013 and has been well received by MSF researchers.

Primary considerations concerned (1) how these data were collected and (2) how patients were informed of the potential uses of their health data. Collecting routine clinical data should presumably follow universal ethical principles and thus might be thought to require consent. The ERB thus encouraged MSF to establish a policy on routine collection of data in clinical settings. The uses of such data may carry a low risk of harm, informing each patient may be difficult to implement and it is arguable that consent to at least some uses is implicit in clinical care.

The increased emphasis in MSF on research led to the creation of an ethics review board (ERB) in 2001. The ERB has encouraged innovation in the review of proposals and the interaction between the ERB and the organization. This has led to some of the advances in ethics governance described in this paper. Discussion: We first update our previous work from 2009 describing ERB performance and then highlight five innovative practices:"},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Abstract","text":"• A new framework to guide ethics review • The introduction of a policy exempting a posteriori analysis of routinely collected data • The preapproval of \"emergency\" protocols • General ethical approval of \"routine surveys\" • Evaluating the impact of approved studies The new framework encourages a conversation about ethical issues, rather than imposing quasi-legalistic rules, is more engaged with the specific MSF research context and gives greater prominence to certain values and principles. Some of the innovations implemented by the ERB, such as review exemption or approval of generic protocols, may run counter to many standard operating procedures. We argue that much standard practice in research ethics review ought to be open to challenge and revision. Continued interaction between MSF researchers and independent ERB members has allowed for progressive innovations based on a trustful and respectful partnership between the ERB and the researchers. In the future, three areas merit particular attention. First, the impact of the new framework should be assessed. Second, the impact of research needs to be defined more precisely as a first step towards being meaningfully assessed, including changes of impact over time. Finally, the dialogue between the MSF ERB and the ethics committees in the study countries should be enhanced.

We speculate that increased numbers of prescriptions for PCR tests for hospitalized patients are responsible for this finding. That means that clinicians are increasingly aware of respiratory viral infection as one of the important causes of hospital-acquired infection. The use of more sensitive PCR kits in recent years may also have affected the incidence of respiratory viral infection. However, because the reported sensitivities of the 2 assays (93.3% and 95.2%, respectively) are similar, 5 the impact of changes in the PCR kits is not likely to have been substantial. Surprisingly, the incidence of respiratory virus infections was highest in ICUs. Considering the brevity of ICU stays (median, 4 days) before the detection of viruses, it is probable that most of the cases were hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections that occurred in wards, not in the ICUs. These findings are consistent with those of a Spanish group, which showed that during the influenza season, 29.5% of critical patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infections had influenza, 42% of which were hospital acquired. 10 It has also been reported that respiratory viruses were responsible for 22.5% of cases of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission in adults. 11 These results strongly suggest that hospital-acquired infections caused by respiratory viruses could lead to serious consequences."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"DISCUSSION","text":"This study had several limitations. First, it was performed at a single, large tertiary care hospital. Our study population included a substantial number of immunocompromised patients who were susceptible to infection, which likely biased our results.

disease-2019 (COVID- 19) , caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was initially reported in December 2019 as pneumonia with unknown etiology in Wuhan city of China. The World Health Organization recognized SARS-CoV-2 as a public health concern and declared it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Over 12 million people have been affected across several countries since it was first recognized [1] . The disease, unless combined with other comorbidities or other preexisting diseases, is usually mild. Approximately 11% of cases require acute medical aid [2] . Broadly, two modes of transmission of COVID-19 exist-direct and indirect [3] . The direct mode includes (1) transmission via aerosols formed via surgical and dental procedures and/or in the form of respiratory droplet nuclei; (2) other body fluids and secretions, for example, feces, saliva, urine, semen, and tears; and (3) mother-to-child. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to commonly spread via respiratory droplets formed while talking, coughing, and sneezing of an infected person. The exposure and, hence, risk of transmission are increased if the infected person is present within 1-m length of susceptible host. Less number of infected patients has shown to shed virus from sources other than the respiratory tract. Though not high, the risk of transmission This article is part of the Topical Collection on Covid-19 through modes other than respiratory tract can still be possible. Indirect transmission may occur via (1) fomites or surfaces (e.g., furniture and fixtures) present within the immediate environment of an infected patient and (2) objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer) [3, 4] . Several of these modes may be underestimated and cause increased spread of virus. The goal of this paper is to briefly review how SARS-CoV-2 is shown to transmit via various modes and propose measures to reduce the risk of spread within the population and operating personnel."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Search Method and Strategy","text":"An electronic search was conducted in the months of May and June 2020 for manuscripts on possible modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

In a study by Li et al., eight healthcare staff and five postoperational patients tested positive for COVID-19 after being in close contact with an infected patient. This suggests that droplet formation serves as a potent mode for human-to-human transmission [6] . In the same study, Li et al. also suggested that cough training (respiratory exercise), which is done postoperatively, produces a large number of droplets and aerosols in the surrounding space. This increases the amount of exposure and, thus, the risk of virus transmission [6] .

To contain the spread of the virus, it is imperative to reduce human-tohuman contact, disinfection of day-to-day objects and proper self-hygiene (washing hands regularly, proper coughing and sneezing techniques, and use of face masks). Social distancing plays a key role in reducing transmission. SARS-CoV-2 has impacted medical practice to a great extent. The use of personal protective equipment among health professionals is essential to reduce the risk of transmission.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to commonly spread via respiratory droplets formed while talking, coughing, and sneezing of an infected patient. As several cases, with an absence of travel history to the majorly affected areas were identified, a strong possibility of community transmission could have been possible. Broadly, two modes of transmission of COVID-19 exist-direct and indirect. The direct mode includes (1) transmission via aerosols formed via surgical and dental procedures and/or in the form of respiratory droplet nuclei; (2) other body fluids and secretions, for example, feces, saliva, urine, semen, and tears; and (3) mother-to-child. Indirect transmission may occur via (1) fomites or surfaces (e.g., furniture and fixtures) present within the immediate environment of an infected patient and (2) objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). As many of these modes may be underestimated, it is necessary to emphasize and illustrate them.

We tried to minimize crowds by expanding mealtime and shower hours, thereby allowing fewer residents into those spaces at any time. We expanded access to hand sanitizers and required all youth to sanitize before entering public spaces. When we asked youth to abide by universal masking, many were initially resistant. Committed to avoiding punitive measures for youth not wearing their masks, we focused on methods of positive reinforcement.

We created posters of staff and celebrities wearing masks and placed them in public locations, but adult modeling had minimal impact on the youth. We took an informal poll to assess how the youth felt about masking and perceived barriers and made changes using the philosophy of rapid process innovation. Surgical masks, which were first available and recommended, were considered the most invasive, uncomfortable, and disruptive of all the interventions. Lack of personal experience with COVID-19, misinformation about their own susceptibility, conspiracy rumors, and general mistrust of government made it difficult for youth to appreciate real risks or the protective benefits of masking. In response, we set out to educate our youth and created customizable pins with the statement \"I wear my mask for.\" and distributed them around the shelter.

It was, however, the eventual donation of masks with the logos of Philadelphia sports teams that enabled us to reach our critical mass. This provided youth with the ability to champion their home sports team in a way similar to wearing a jersey or baseball cap while abiding by universal masking. We are now proudly at a point where on average about three-quarters of the residents wear their masks at any time while inside the shelter.

Our open-door policy was perhaps what we both valued and feared most. What we discovered through our efforts is not a surprise to those familiar with adolescents. Diffusion of innovation, in this case universal masking, is largely dependent on the influence of early adopters [1, 2] . We also know that perceptions about peer behaviors motivate change [5] . Decisions made in adolescence are intimately bound to social context and the perception of normative behaviors. Once we reached critical mass in our universal masking, youth perception of peer behavior shifted and redefined what was considered normative. Innovations that involve a behavior change among youth need early adoption from a few prominent individuals. However, we must accept the power of peer influence and use it to our advantage, by first learning from youth what attracts and engages them.

Parmi ces pathogènes, seuls quelques uns sont capables d'induire des tableaux sévères dont le diagnostic comme la prise en charge sont assez difficiles à réaliser.

Ces pneumonies restent malgré tout rares chez l'immunocompétent, et doivent systématiquement faire rechercher une pathologie ou un traitement immunosuppresseur si le diagnostic est confirmé : en dehors de la grippe et de la pneumonie à SRAS-coronavirus, une infection par un herpès virus, un rhinovirus ou autre est relativement exceptionnelle chez l'immunocompétent.

L'infection à CMV est fréquente dans la population générale avec un niveau de séroprévalence reporté entre 40 à 100 % ; la distribution en fonction de l'âge est bimodale et deux pics sont décrits : le premier dans la petite enfance témoigne d'une transmission verticale qui peut être rattachée à l'allaitement maternel [1, 2] . Le second pic de séroconversion survient chez le jeune adulte, la transmission est essentiellement d'origine sexuelle [3] . La réponse à l'infection liée au CMV fait intervenir à la fois l'immunité cellulaire et l'immunité humorale ; cependant l'absence d'immunité cellulaire représente le facteur prédisposant le plus important des infections liées à ce pathogène. Pour cette raison, l'infection à CMV est généralement rencontrée en pathologie hématologique, dans un contexte de transplantation ou en cas d'infection VIH évoluée. Comme pour les autres infections à herpès virus, au décours de la primo-infection, le CMV demeure indéfiniment latent chez l'hôte, pouvant être à l'origine de réactivation et de réinfections successives dans le temps [4, 5] . Le mécanisme exact de la réactivation n'est pas encore totalement élucidé mais résulte le plus souvent d'une altération de la balance entre les défenses de l'hôte et le virus latent expliquant le caractère exceptionnel des infections respiratoires à CMV chez l'adulte immunocompétent [6] .

La pneumonie à CMV a été confirmée chez 25 patients, la symptomatologie clinique était totalement atypique dans la plupart des cas, ce sous-groupe de patients présentait néanmoins une hypoxémie plus sévère et une atteinte radiologique plus importante. La force de cette étude repose sur l'utilisation de critères histologiques dans le diagnostic de l'infection à CMV. En concordance avec ces résultats, Heninger et al., dans une unité de réanimation chirurgicale ont suivi 56 patients porteurs d'IgG anti-CMV au cours de leur hospitalisation [9] . Une fois par semaine, la recherche de CMV était réalisée par PCR et culture virale à partir d'échantillons sanguins et respiratoires. Vingt patients ont développé une infection active ; pour sept d'entre eux, le virus fut isolé des sécrétions respiratoires. Le seul facteur de risque mis en évidence par l'analyse multivariée était l'existence d'un sepsis (Odds ratio : 4,62). D'autres publications avaient aussi retrouvé le sepsis comme facteur favorisant d'une réactivation de l'infection à CMV avec des pourcentages variant entre 45 et 97 % [10, 11] . Le mécanisme responsable de la réactivation d'une infection à CMV latente impliquerait l'existence d'un déséquilibre de la réponse immune induit par une augmentation de production du TNF-a [10] . D'autres facteurs pourraient aussi être mis en cause comme l'existence d'une chirurgie ou d'une anesthésie qui ont toutes deux montré leur capacité à altérer la réponse immunitaire [12, 13] .

En dehors de la grippe et du SRAS, une pneumonie sévère virale est rare chez le sujet immunocompétent et doit, à ce titre, si le diagnostic est confirmé, initier une enquête à la recherche d'un facteur immunosuppresseur sous-jacent que ce soit une pathologie (néoplasie, VIH, ...) ou un traitement (corticothérapie).

Many different agents, such as influenza and parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncitial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus and herpes virus can be found in immuno-competent patients. Among these pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been found to be responsible for nosocomial pneumonia in ICU. The main problem for viral infections, is the diagnosis, isolation of the pathogen is often difficult and not always reliable and the symptoms not specific. However, influenza is characterised by fever, myalgia, headache and pharyngitis, this infection may be very mild, even asymptomatic, moderate or very severe. Finally, the most recent viral pathogen involved in respiratory disease is a newly discovered coronavirus, the SARS-CoV which was responsible for the worldwide outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Viral pneumonia is a common pathology which is probably underdiagnosed in immuno-competent patients; many reports show that even if the diagnosis is difficult to obtain, it is not useless as long as we have, for most of the pathogens, an effective treatment.

Cette technique a cependant une faible valeur prédictive, est lente et n'est pas quantitative. Sa sensibilité est inférieure à celle de la PCR. Une certaine amélioration de la technique dite « rapide » a permis de diminuer la durée de culture à 48 heures en réalisant une centrifugation des échantillons sur une monocouche de fibroblastes avant la recherche de l'effet cytopathogène par anticorps monoclonaux [15]. 2.1.3.2.

Les résultats sont cependant assez hétérogènes d'une publication à l'autre et en fonction du type d'échantillon analysé. Dans une étude regroupant 363 patients atteints de pneumonie interstitielle, la PCR CMV s'est avérée positive pour 58 des 882 échantillons testés [16].

Although rates vary, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, up to 30% make their way to the ICU. Among those who are critically ill, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS is the dominant finding, which may require invasive mechanical ventilation. 2 In up to 98% of nonsurvivors from COVID-19, high mortality was associated with severe respiratory failure from viral pneumonia. 3, 4 The conventional management of patients with ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation includes lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume, high PEEP, deep sedation, prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade with the use of paralytics, steroids, and inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. 5, 6 Although robust evidence in support of benefit with the use of ECMO for ARDS is lacking, it serves as a rescue therapy with a mortality benefit in patients with severe reversible acute respiratory failure when the conventional therapies have failed. 7-9 ECMO is not a disease-modifying therapy and does not cure lung disease, rather it serves as a bridge to lung recovery by allowing \"lung rest\" to the damaged alveoli in ARDS. It allows the use of lung-protective ventilation strategies by reducing mechanical power and driving pressure. 7,10 ECMO therapy has been used in patients with ARDS since 1970, however, it has become more popular in the last decade due to remarkable progress in the ECMO circuit components, increased safety, and availability. Improvement in mortality with ECMO was reported in the non-randomized studies during the influenza A H1N1 epidemic in 2009 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus epidemic in 2014, supporting the use of ECMO for refractory hypoxemia. [11] [12] [13] As the world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of ECMO in ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is being explored. Early reports from China on the use of ECMO for COVID-19 suggested a high mortality rate of around 80% to 90% in adult patients with ARDS. 14, 15 There is some encouraging evidence in the form of case reports and series suggesting clinical benefit with the use of ECMO in COVID-19. [16] [17] [18] In a recent case series of 6 patients by Osho and colleagues, 19 5 patients survived severe ARDS due to COVID-19 with VV ECMO. The median duration of VV ECMO in these patients was 12 days (4-18 days). Jacobs and colleagues published an analysis of 32 patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO. They demonstrated that 22 of 32 patients were alive (68%), with 17 of 32 (53.1%) alive on ECMO at the time of publication. Five out of 15 (33.3%) who had been decannulated survived post-ECMO removal. 20 With our case report, we attempt to highlight a case of a young otherwise healthy male, who developed severe ARDS and completely recovered with the use of ECMO therapy."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[{"ref_id":"BIBREF9","start":508,"text":"10","end":510},{"ref_id":"BIBREF10","start":836,"text":"11","end":838},{"ref_id":"BIBREF20","start":1387,"text":"21","end":1389},{"ref_id":"BIBREF10","start":1660,"text":"11","end":1662},{"ref_id":"BIBREF9","start":2651,"text":"10","end":2653},{"ref_id":"BIBREF6","start":3416,"text":"7,","end":3418},{"ref_id":"BIBREF10","start":3419,"text":"11","end":3421},{"ref_id":"BIBREF21","start":3858,"text":"22,","end":3861},{"ref_id":"BIBREF22","start":3862,"text":"23","end":3864},{"ref_id":"BIBREF21","start":4196,"text":"22","end":4198},{"ref_id":"BIBREF22","start":4658,"text":"23","end":4660}],"section":"Discussion","text":"There are 2 main types of ECMO circuits: venoarterial (VA) and VV. VV ECMO provides respiratory support within an extracorporeal circuit and is meant to treat hypercarbia and hypoxemia. VV is by far the most common convention used in the management of refractory ARDS. VV ECMO could be performed either via a single dual-lumen catheter usually in the neck, or via dual-site cannulation, which draws blood from the femoral vein and reinfuses it in the internal jugular vein or the contralateral femoral vein. 10 Dual-site cannulation could be performed at the bedside without the requirement for transesophageal echocardiogram and fluoroscopy. Therefore, for patients with COVID-19, dual-site cannulation is preferable for respiratory support as it reduces the potential exposure of the health care workers and utilization of resources. 11 Most of the reported experience with ECMO for COVID-19 is with VV ECMO. VA ECMO is used to provide both mechanical circulatory and respiratory support. COVID-19 is a multisystem disorder that is also associated with cardiovascular complications such as acute myocarditis, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure. However, the experience with VA ECMO in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited. To date, only 1 case of fulminant myocarditis in a patient with COVID-19 has been reported who was successfully rescued with VA ECMO as a bridge to recovery. 21 ECMO could act as potentially life-saving therapy in COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia and terminal respiratory failure. However, ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients poses a lot of additional challenges that could affect how ECMO is delivered for ARDS patients. 11 ECMO facility is available in specialized centers. It requires a team of expert personnel experienced in initiating, maintaining, and discontinuing ECMO and managing its related complications. Due to the worldwide pandemic, there is a huge burden on the health care resources for the management of patients with COVID-19. The use of ECMO for COVID-19 also involves ethical challenges. It diverts the already overwhelmed health care resources from the other critically ill patients. ECMO is a high resource-intensive and prolonged mode of treatment. Additionally, ECMO management enhances the potential exposure of health care workers to SARS COV-2, which is a highly transmissible disease, especially with the limited personal protective equipment across many hospitals. ECMO therapy is also inherently associated with complications that increase morbidity and mortality such as the increased risk of hemorrhage due to the use of anticoagulant, and systemic thrombosis among many others. 10 At this time, there are no defined guidelines for selecting patients with COVID-19 patients for ECMO therapy. Based on the experience gained during the management of patients with SARS COV (2003), H1N1 influenza A, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, patients who are young and have fewer or no comorbidities are expected to have the highest probability of survival and should be given preference for consideration for ECMO in COVID-19 patients. Patients with advanced age, terminal diseases such as advanced malignancy, severe multiorgan failure, severe neurologic damage such as anoxic brain injury, inability to receive blood transfusions, or anticoagulation would be some of the absolute contraindications to ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients. 7, 11 To ensure the ethical distribution of resources, the relative and absolute contraindications may vary with time as the health care resources get overburdened due to the progressing COVID-19 pandemic. Although not prospectively validated in COVID-19 patients, the pulmonary and extrapulmonary predictive survival models such as RESP and PRESET might serve as decision support in COVID-19 patients with ARDS to be placed on ECMO therapy. 22, 23 The RESP score was developed in 2014 by Schmidt and colleagues 22 through a multi-center retrospective cohort study with 2355 patients from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry. It was created as a predictor of survival to hospital discharge for adult patients receiving ECMO for acute respiratory failure. 22 The tool includes 12 different patient variables that add up to a final score between ≥6 and ≤−6 with each score being associated with 6 different risk classes of in-hospital survival. The higher the score, the lower the risk class for ECMO candidacy, and subsequently the higher the predicted in-hospital survival. The PRESET score was developed in 2017 through a derivation cohort study of 108 ARDS patients receiving VV ECMO at a single center in Germany. 23 It was created as a predictor of ICU survival for ARDS patients receiving ECMO. The tool includes 5 different patient variables, all of which are extrapulmonary. The total score ranges from 0 to 15 and each score places the patient in 1 of the 3 risk classes. The higher the score, the higher the risk class, and subsequently the higher the expected ICU mortality."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Discussion","text":"We suggest that early referral to specialized tertiary care centers equipped with resources, expertise, and standardized ECMO protocols should be considered for patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19.

We have discussed above how to perform the method suffix dfa. It is easy to pass in the reversal of a language to suffix dfa, in time linear in s L . Then, in line 5 of Algorithm 1, we can check to see if the intersection is empty by keeping a counter starting at k and running w through the transition function of M , decreasing the counter at each step. Then, when the counter reaches 0, we test every state we hit on input w to see whether it is a final state. If it is, we increase l 1 and set v 1 indicating that w ∈ Z(1, L, k). Also, in line 8, we are testing whether w R ∈ Z(1, L R , k). Indeed, by Lemma 2(3), w R ∈ Z(1, L R , k) if and only if w ∈ Z(2, L, k). Thus, if this is true, we increase l 2 and set v 2 to true. In addition, w ∈ Z (3, L, k) if and only if w ∈ Z(1, L, k) ∪ Z(2, L, k) and so we increase l 3 if and only if either v 1 or v 2 is true, and we reset each to false. In this way, when the method completes, l 1 , l 2 and l 3 will be the maximum such that L satisfies W (1, k, l 1 ), W (2, k, l 2 ) and W (3, k, l 3 ), respectively. Furthermore, this method runs in time O(s L ) time. In addition, it is well-known that we can test whether a word w is in the language generated by an NFA in time O(|Q||w|) (see [6] ). Thus, to find the largest integer l 6 such that L satisfies W (6, k, l), we construct the NFA from L and decide membership of w R for each w ∈ L. This takes time O(|w 1 ||Q| + · · · + |w m ||Q|) = O(|Q|s L ). Thus, one can decide whether a finite language L satisfies W (6, k, l) in time O(s 2 L ). Finally, the strong properties can also be verified straightforwardly using the algorithms presented above. Indeed, they are just a special case where l = |L|. We summarize the preceding thusly: Proposition 4. Let i satisfy 1 ≤ i ≤ 5 and let Σ be some fixed alphabet. Then given a finite language L ⊆ Σ + as input without duplicates and k ∈ N, we can both find the largest integer l such that L satisfies W (i, k, l) and we can decide whether L satisfies V (i, k) in time O(s L ).

We have shown dependencies and relationships between these properties and demonstrated that, in general, most of the weak versions of the properties can be decided for languages defined by nondeterministic finite automata augmented with reversal-bounded counters while the strong versions can be decided for regular languages. Most significantly, we have given algorithms which can efficiently decide these properties for real viral genomes and provide information which is immediately useful to virologists. These algorithms give us the ability to study the relative amount of gene compression between related viruses in a quantifiable way. It may be possible to infer evolutionary relationships between viruses using this information. The fact that genes overlap one another provides a very serious constraint for viral genome evolution. It is known that viruses occasionally aquire genes horizontally (that is, a gene from an infected host becomes part of the virus's own genome). Clearly, only those genes which meet very specific constraints (e.g. those that are \"compressible\" relative to the virus's genome) will be able to be incorporated into the virus. Using the algorithms presented here and real viral genome data, we can find target genes in the host organism which, due to their structure, have the greatest probability of being incorporated into the viral genome."},{"ref_spans":[],"cite_spans":[],"section":"Conclusions and Discussion","text":"Finally, the formal properties here also present a framework for automated classification of a virus given only its genome.
