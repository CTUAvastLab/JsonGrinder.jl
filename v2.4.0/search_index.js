The drawback is that if one is processing a JSONs with sufficiently big schema, each BagNode can potentially create two types –- one with missing and the other with x <: AbstractNode. This will trigger a lot of compilation, which at the moment can take quite some time especially when calculating gradients with Zygote.\nx <: AbstractNode with numobs(x) = 0. In other words, x would be the same type as it is if it contains instances, but it does not any observations. This has the advantage that all extracted samples will be of the same type and therefore there will be only single compilation for inference (and gradients). This is nice, but at the expense of less elegant code and probably small overhead caused by descending into children. This approach also needs a support from extractors, as creating an empty sample might be a bit tricky.

Of course we can afford it only for small datasets, but for the sake of simplicity we keep whole dataset in memory, while recognizing this is usually not feasible in real-world scenarios. Data are stored in a format \"json per line\". This means that each sample is one JSON document stored in each line. These samples are loaded and parsed to an array. On the end, one sample is printed to show, how data looks like.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/recipes/","page":"Recipe Ingredients Example","title":"Recipe Ingredients Example","text":"src magic for resolving paths","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/recipes/","page":"Recipe Ingredients Example","title":"Recipe Ingredients Example","text":"data_file = \"../../../data/recipes.json\"\nsamples = open(data_file,\"r\") do fid\n\tVector{Dict}(JSON.parse(read(fid, String)))\nend\nJSON.print(samples[1],2)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/recipes/","page":"Recipe Ingredients Example","title":"Recipe Ingredients Example","text":"{\n  \"id\": 10259,\n  \"ingredients\": [\n    \"romaine lettuce\",\n    \"black olives\",\n    \"grape tomatoes\",\n    \"garlic\",\n    \"pepper\",\n    \"purple onion\",\n    \"seasoning\",\n    \"garbanzo beans\",\n    \"feta cheese crumbles\"\n  ],\n  \"cuisine\": \"greek\"\n}\n","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/recipes/","page":"Recipe Ingredients Example","title":"Recipe Ingredients Example","text":"Now we create schema of the JSON.
